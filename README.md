Synacor Challenge
-----------------

# Running
    cargo run

# Extracting codes
    cargo run | grep --color "\w\{12\}"

Remember to reverse the final code (including d/b's!)

It'll default to using the predefined script. Simply rename or delete `script.txt` for fully interactive goodness.

# Commands
    "hack teleporter" - Run this just before using the teleporter to bring you to the second location
    "save" - Save the VM state
    "load" - Load the VM state
